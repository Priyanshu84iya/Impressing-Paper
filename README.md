Namaskar! To replace `script.js` with `mobile.js` in your `index.html` file, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your `index.html` file in a text editor.
2. Locate the line where `script.js` is included. It should look something like this:
   ```html
   <script src="script.js"></script>
   ```
3. Replace `script.js` with `mobile.js` so it looks like this:
   ```html
   <script src="mobile.js"></script>
   ```
4. Save the changes to your `index.html` file.

This will ensure that your website uses `mobile.js` instead of `script.js` when accessed on mobile devices.
